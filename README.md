# No-Commander-Extend-Vote
Extend commander vote when nobody opted in and someone voted for him </br>

Created by Neoony </br>

THIS IS IN VERY EARLY STATE, TESTING PRINT TO CHAT MESSAGES ARE STILL IN, SO THAT I CAN EASILY SEE WHEN THINGS HAPPEN  </br>

If the commander vote time is below 60 it will add extra time if no team has yet voted for a commander. </br>
It will keep extending the vote time by approximately 20 seconds, each time it gets below 60 seconds with no comms  </br>

Issues: </br>
If somebody opts in for a commander and somebody votes for him, and then the commander opts out, it will still count as if the team has a commander. </br>
In other way, its set to "team has commander" if somebody in that team votes for a comm event. </br>
If you can think of another way, Iam all ears. But no event seems to exist for somebody just opting in or opting out or taking his vote back </br>

Planned features </br>
If the game starts without a commander elected, it will start a vote for next map and change the map. </br>
